# SumoBot
Minecraft Sumo Bot

This project is aimed at creating sumo bot (hopefully with some sophisticated movements) in Minecraft using python, especially Machine Learning.

Dependencies are:
ctypes, os, [keyboard](https://github.com/boppreh/keyboard), pywin32, mss, socket, numpy, and multiprocessing.
The threads were made with threading, and with the basics from [TechWithTim](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC4JX40jDee_tINbkjycV4Sg) Youtube Channel - Python Online Game Tutorial.

**Training was made possible with help of [RaspberryJamMod](https://github.com/arpruss/raspberryjammod) by @arpuss which makes it possible to interact with Minecraft world.**
